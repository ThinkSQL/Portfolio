-- I'd love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 â€” Nov 10), 
-- in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month (up to 2012-11-27) to understand monthly impact.
